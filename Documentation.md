## Abstract

## Introduction (Domain Description, Motivation and Scope of the Work)


### Domain Description

This is a frontend web application to visualize Covid-19 data and statistics in India.
It is made using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### Motivation

We have come across many websites displaying Covid-19 statistics but we werenâ€™t satisfied with the way it was visualized. We felt that it should be easier to understand and should be visually appealing.

One other factor that makes our project different is that Volunteers and Organizations can register with us and their contact details will be there on our website for people needing help in this pandemic situation.
