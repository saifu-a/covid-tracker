## Abstract

## Introduction (Domain Description, Motivation and Scope of the Work)

### Domain Description

This is a frontend web application to visualize Covid-19 data and statistics in India.
It is made using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

### Motivation

We have come across many websites displaying Covid-19 statistics but we werenâ€™t satisfied with the way it was visualized. We felt that it should be easier to understand and should be visually appealing.

One other factor that makes our project different is that Volunteers and Organizations can register with us and their contact details will be there on our website for people needing help in this pandemic situation.

### Scope of the Work

As with Covid-19 data, this project can be used to visualize any kind of data in a much simpler and beautiful way. It can be applied to visualize Financial data, Scientific data, etc.

## Implementation

### Techonologies Used

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Firebase

#### HTML

The HyperText Markup Language, or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.

Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.

#### CSS

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript. CSS is designed to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts.

#### JavaScript

JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled, and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.

#### Firebase

Firebase (a NoSQLjSON database) is a real-time database that allows storing a list of objects in the form of a tree. We can synchronize data between different devices. Firebase manages real-time data in the database. So, it easily and quickly exchanges the data to and from the database. Hence, for developing mobile apps such as live streaming, chat messaging, etc., we can use Firebase.

### Additional Libraries Used

- Google Fonts
- Animate on Scroll
- Normalize.css
- geoPlugin
- Moment.js
- Chart.js
- SweetAlert.js
